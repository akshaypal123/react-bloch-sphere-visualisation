# Bloch Sphere Visualisation
## Description 📄

This project builds an interactive visualisation of the Bloch sphere from quantum computing. The Bloch sphere allows us to visualise the qubit as a vector on the surface of a sphere

## Features ✨

- Rendering of Bloch sphere and qubit vector using **Three.js and React Three Fibre**
- Angle sliders you can **drag and click** interactively to adjust the qubit state
- **Four quantum gates** to manipulate the qubit

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **React**
- **React Three Fibre**
- **Three.js**
- **Vite.js**
